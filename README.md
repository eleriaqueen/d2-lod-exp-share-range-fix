# Diablo II - LOD - "Exp Share Range Fix"
Get rid of the two-screen experience share range limit.

This method changes the target address of a jump to be the next instruction instead of its original address (essentially NOP-ing it)

## Details
This repository contains enough info to be able to manually patch D2Game.dll (Or Game.exe in the case of game version 1.14 and up) with the fix.

For their posts on the Phrozen Keep which helped me find the right offsets for several game versions
